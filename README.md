## About Simply

Simply, in most basic sense, is a real estate listing aggregation web application but with a twist. Rather than being just a platform on which users search for listing, we strive to personalize the whole real estate experience for users by first getting to know them.

This is how it works: first, we get to know the user by asking few simple questions about what they are looking for. Then we find the best listings that match users' criteria by price, best location, or ease of transportation. From there, we help you make a decision on plaecs to visit and contact you for the real estate agent if you choose to make an offer. After all, finding a great place you love should be fun not a big hassle to go through.
